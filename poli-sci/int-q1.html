    <h3>2025 Senior Systems Analyst — Practical Examination Response</h3>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="q">1) You are given an existing program with full source code and access to its data sources. How would you approach supporting and planning for the future of this program?</div>
      I bring the app up in a safe environment, readme/commits first, then draw a quick data/flow diagram. I list bugs, risks, and performance hot spots. Next, I stabilize: add basic tests, pin dependencies, remove hard-coded secrets, set up simple CI and a rollback. I meet stakeholders to confirm what must not break, what can wait, and what to improve. I publish a small roadmap (stability → reliability → new value) with clear owners, SLAs, and success metrics. I finish with plain runbooks and “how to build/deploy/restore” docs.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="q">2) Describe how you would lead a project where you’re tasked with providing a technical solution to a client’s business problem.</div>
      I start with a short discovery: problem, users, constraints, risks, and success measures. I translate this into a simple charter and a prioritized backlog. I run short iterations with demos so the client sees progress early. I de-risk with a quick spike on the hardest part. I keep security, data, and infra in scope from day one. Before go-live: UAT, cutover plan, and support plan. After go-live: training, docs, and a brief “what we learned.”

    <div class="section">
      <div class="q">3) Suppose you need to pull data from one source and integrate it into another. How would you approach this problem considering multiple formats (flat files, APIs, point-to-point connections)?</div>
      I write a short mapping: keys, fields, types, and cadence. Data lands in a staging area, then transforms, then merges into target (idempotent). Flat files: schema checks, safe batching, clear rejects. APIs: auth, paging, retries, backoff, and audit logs. Point-to-point: prefer a queue/middleware to decouple. I add simple data-quality rules (nulls, ranges, dupes), alerts, and a replay path. A lightweight dashboard shows latency, volume, and failures.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="q">4) You’re working in a team where several strong personalities insist on an approach that you believe is not the best solution. How would you handle this situation?</div>
      I make options visible side-by-side with agreed criteria: reliability, security, cost, time, and support load. We run a short, time-boxed prototype to gather data. I separate people from ideas, note trade-offs, and look for “good now, better later.” If needed, I bring in a neutral reviewer and document the decision with a check-in date tied to metrics.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="q">5) How do you adjust your communication style when discussing complex technical topics with technical peers versus non-technical stakeholders?</div>
      With peers: precise terms, diagrams, benchmarks, and trade-offs. With non-technical folks: plain language, outcomes, timelines, risks, and cost; one simple visual per idea. In both cases I confirm understanding and next steps in writing.

    <h3>Practical Notes (Condensed Experience)</h3>
    <div class="section">
      Data and systems work across Python/SQL/PHP; ETL design and monitoring; CI/CD hygiene; legacy refactors; Tableau/Plotly dashboards; AWS EMR/S3 basics; and GIS field data (ArcGIS). These inform how I stabilize code, move data safely, and ship solutions that are easy to support.
