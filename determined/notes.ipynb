    "Key ideas\n",
    "- “defending broken people who were usually already lost by the time they were second-trimester fetuses.”\n",
    "- “One possibility is the “truth and reconciliation commission” model”\n",
    "- incompatibilist philosopher Derk Pereboom (Cornell University) criminology:\n",
    " - (A) Some people are dangerous because of problems with the likes of impulse control, propensity for violence, or incapacity for empathy. \n",
    " - (B) If you truly accept that there is no free will, it’s not their fault—it’s the result of their genes, fetal life, hormone levels, the usual. \n",
    " - (C) Nonetheless, the public needs to be protected from them until they can be rehabilitated, if possible, justifying the constraint of their freedom. \n",
    " - (D) But their “quarantine” should be done in a way that constrains the least—do what’s needed to make them safe, and in all other ways, they’re free to be.\n",
    "- Philosopher Gregg Caruso of the State University of New York\n",
    " - **“while a criminal can be dangerous, the poverty, bias, systemic disadvantaging, and so on that produce criminals are more dangerous.”**\n",
    " - “least infringement” has to be coupled with a paramount focus on the social determinants of criminality”\n",
    "  - e.g. “Sure, spot the guy whose costly and growing addiction to a street drug is about to lead him to mug people, get him into rehab to writhe and shiver and puke in a safe setting, but also do something about how he was taught no skills and has no job options.”\n",
    "- “terrible people are produced by terrible circumstances” ~ Dr. Sapolsky \n",
    "- “Law professor Susan Bandes of DePaul University finds that for many, the execution and the accompanying media coverage are retraumatizing, impeding their recovery. {A small number oppose the execution}”\n",
